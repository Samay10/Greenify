# Greenify üå±

An intelligent routing system that helps users make environmentally conscious travel decisions by predicting and minimizing carbon emissions for different routes.

## Features

### üó∫Ô∏è Smart Route Analysis
- Real-time route calculation using HERE Maps API
- Distance and travel time estimation
- Carbon emission predictions for different routes
- Intelligent route recommendations based on environmental impact

### ü§ñ Machine Learning Capabilities
- Neural network model for accurate emission predictions
- Considers multiple factors:
  - Distance
  - Traffic conditions
  - Weather conditions
- Trained on real-world emissions data
- Continuous learning and improvement

### üìä Environmental Impact Metrics
- Carbon emission calculations in grams/kilograms
- Comparative analysis between routes
- Historical data tracking
- Environmental impact visualization

## API Documentation

### Route Calculation
```python
GET /api/routes
Parameters:
- origin: string (latitude,longitude)
- destination: string (latitude,longitude)
- mode: string (car, bicycle, walking)

Response:
{
    "distance": float,
    "duration": float,
    "carbon_emissions": float,
    "route_options": [...]
}
```

### Carbon Prediction
```python
POST /api/predict
Body:
{
    "distance": float,
    "traffic_level": int (1-10),
    "weather_condition": int (1-10)
}

Response:
{
    "predicted_emissions": float,
    "confidence_level": float
}
```

## Machine Learning Model

The system uses a neural network with:
- Input features: distance, traffic level, weather conditions
- Hidden layers: 64 and 32 neurons with ReLU activation
- Output: predicted carbon emissions
- Training metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
